As standard in opencart, this is solved by options. But what if "Alcohol 1l" - "Alcohol 5l" in 1c are separate products and have their own article and should be the same in the store, respectively?

The module solves this problem:

After installation in the product card, you can select the product that will be the main one, and on the "Product offers" tab

select the products that you want to show in his card.

Also in the module there is a checkbox "Show only the main product".

By selecting it, we will hide from the client all child products from the main list (child products will be visible only in the main product card)

The module has been tested and works on version 2.3. Installation is simple: load the admin and catalog folders on the server and install the xml. In general, everything is standard.
